## Introduction



Using Vanilla JS to generate entire contents of a website.
Practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage. In this case Waffle House. An American restaurant chain with 2,100 locations in 25 states in the United States. Most of the locations are in the South.
Trying out the trendy glass effect CSS looks. ⚫ and 🟨 are always cool to play with.
